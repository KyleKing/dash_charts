# Developer Notes

## Local Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kyleking/dash_charts.git
cd dash_charts
poetry install

# See the available tasks
poetry run doit list

# Run the default task list (lint, auto-format, test coverage, etc.)
poetry run doit --continue

# Make code changes and run specific tasks as needed:
poetry run doit run test
```

## Publishing

For testing, create an account on [TestPyPi](https://test.pypi.org/legacy/). Replace `...` with the API token generated on TestPyPi|PyPi respectively

```sh
poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
poetry config pypi-token.testpypi ...

poetry run doit run publish_test_pypi
# If you didn't configure a token, you will need to provide your username and password to publish
```

To publish to the real PyPi

```sh
poetry config pypi-token.pypi ...
poetry run doit run publish

# For a full release, triple check the default tasks, increment the version, rebuild documentation, and publish!
poetry run doit run --continue
poetry run doit run cl_bump lock document deploy_docs publish

# For pre-releases use cl_bump_pre
poetry run doit run cl_bump_pre -p rc
poetry run doit run lock document deploy_docs publish
```
