# dash_charts

> **Note**
>
> In 2019-2020, I was building applications with Dash and wanted a way to make them more composable and reusable. Since then, I moved on to other projects and Dash has become far more composable. Dash expanded plotly express and introduced templates along with other changes as the ecosystem has evolved!
>
> Given the advances in Dash, I'm going to archive this project, publish a final release to PyPi, and move on to other projects
